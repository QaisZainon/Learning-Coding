# CSV
import csv
# imports a module to read and write csv files
exampleFile = open('example.csv')
exampleReader = csv.reader(exampleFile)
# opens the file, and then reads it 
.line_num 
# adds the current line for the list in a for loop
# apparently the reader object can only be looped over once?

outputFile = open('output.csv','w',newline='')
outputWriter = csv.writer(outPutFile)
# opens the file in write mode 
# the purpose of the newline argument is to avoid double spacing which is the default setting
outputWriter.writerow()
# adds lines into the csv file
outputFile.close()
# closes the file 
csvWriter = csv.writer(outputFile, delimiter='\t', lineterminator='\n\n')
# changes the attributes, delimiter the thing between the words, linterminator is new lines

# DictReader is basically the same thing, but instead uses dictionary instead of a list
# Essentially you dont have to skip the first row when reading the csv file
exampleFile = open('example.csv')
exampleDictReader = csv.DictReader(exampleFile, ['time','name','amount'])
# basically defines the the columsn first so that you can call it in the future
exampleDictReader.writeheader()
# actually writes down the header into the csv file
